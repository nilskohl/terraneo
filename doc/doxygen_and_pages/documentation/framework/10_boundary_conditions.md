### Poisson-like problems

#### Algebraic elimination

Consider the linear system

\f[
A x = b ,
\f]

arising from a Poisson-like operator without any boundary treatment (\f$A\f$ is the "Neumann" operator), with Dirichlet
conditions prescribed on a subset of degrees of freedom \f$d\f$:

\f[
x_d = g_d .
\f]

Reorder unknowns as

\f[
x =
\begin{pmatrix} x_i \\ x_d \end{pmatrix}, \quad
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
A_{ii} & A_{id} \\
A_{di} & A_{dd}
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
b =
\begin{pmatrix} b_i \\ b_d \end{pmatrix}.
\f]

Define the lifting vector

\f[
g =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ g_d
\end{pmatrix},
\f]

i.e. zero on interior degrees of freedom and equal to the prescribed
Dirichlet values on boundary degrees of freedom. Also define

\f[
\hat x =
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{i} \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\f]

i.e., \f$\hat x_d = 0\f$, and \f$x = \hat x + g\f$.
Substitution into the linear system gives the lifted equation

\f[
\begin{aligned}
Ax &= A(\hat x + g) = A \hat x + A g = b \\
A \hat x &= b - A g .
\end{aligned}
\f]

To enforce \f$\hat x_d=0\f$ strongly while preserving symmetry, eliminate all
off-diagonal couplings to Dirichlet degrees of freedom:

\f[
A_{\mathrm{elim}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
A_{ii} & 0 \\
0 & A_{dd}
\end{pmatrix}.
\f]

Define the modified right-hand side

\f[
b_{\mathrm{elim}} = b - A g ,
\f]

and then overwrite its Dirichlet components by

\f[
b_{\mathrm{elim},d} = A_{dd} g_d,
\f]

s.t., overall
\f[
b_{\mathrm{elim}} =
\begin{pmatrix} b_{\mathrm{elim},i} \\ b_{\mathrm{elim},d} \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} b_i - A_{id} g_d \\ A_{dd} g_d \end{pmatrix}.
\f]

The eliminated system is

\f[
A_{\mathrm{elim}} x = b_{\mathrm{elim}}.
\f]

The interior equations read

\f[
A_{ii} x_i = b_i - A_{id} g_d ,
\f]

while the boundary equations enforce

\f[
A_{dd} x_d = A_{dd} g_d \;\Rightarrow\; x_d = g_d .
\f]

Thus, the Dirichlet conditions are imposed strongly, and the interior solution
satisfies the standard reduced system.

This procedure is equivalent to a symmetric Gaussian elimination of Dirichlet
degrees of freedom. It preserves:

- symmetry of the operator,
- positive definiteness for Poisson-like problems,
- exact strong enforcement of Dirichlet data.

The diagonal entries corresponding to Dirichlet nodes are retained, which is
advantageous for conditioning and iterative solvers.

Let \f$g\f$ be the lifting vector. Then:

\f[
y = A g ,
\f]
\f[
b_{\mathrm{elim}} = b - y ,
\f]
\f[
b_{\mathrm{elim},d} = \mathrm{diag}(A)\, g_d .
\f]

The operator \f$A_{\mathrm{elim}}\f$ is applied by symmetrically zeroing all
off-diagonal entries in rows and columns corresponding to Dirichlet degrees
of freedom. In a matrix-free context, this symmetric zeroing can be implemented
by applying it to each local element matrix. In fact, this is exactly what is
happening in the operators implemented in this framework (more details below).

Solving \f$A_{\mathrm{elim}} x = b_{\mathrm{elim}}\f$ yields the solution of
the original Dirichlet problem.

#### Realization in the framework

To solve the problem
\f[
A_{\mathrm{elim}} x = b_{\mathrm{elim}}
\f]
that has been introduced above, we need several ingredients:

- the original ("Neumann") operator \f$A\f$ (evaluating volume integrals everywhere),
- the operator \f$A_{\mathrm{elim}}\f$ (that one is typically already implemented in the framework and elimination is
  enabled by setting a flag in the constructor that switches between the "Neumann" and "eliminated" versions),
- the diagonal entries of \f$A\f$, \f$\mathrm{diag}(A)\f$ (note that
  \f$\mathrm{diag}(A) = \mathrm{diag}(A_{\mathrm{elim}})\f$ by design),
- the interpolated boundary conditions \f$g\f$ (the "lifting vector" - zero on interior degrees of freedom and equal
  to the prescribed Dirichlet values on boundary degrees of freedom),
- the original forcing vector \f$b\f$ (without any boundary treatment, but already in the form of a coefficient vector,
  typically the result of evaluating a linear form on some analytical function).

Having the operators instantiated, it only remains to build the right-hand side vector \f$b_{\mathrm{elim}}\f$ and
solve the system. To build the vector, helper functions such as
@ref terra::fe::strong_algebraic_dirichlet_enforcement_poisson_like should be used that perform all the necessary steps.
Concretely, the steps are:

1. \f$ g_A \gets A g \f$,
2. \f$ g_D \gets \mathrm{diag}(A) g \f$,
3. \f$ b_\text{elim} \gets b - g_A \f$,
4. \f$ b_{\text{elim},d} \gets g_D \f$, i.e., setting the RHS \f$ b_\mathrm{elim} \f$ to \f$ g_D \f$ at the boundary
   nodes.

It then remains to pass the system:
\f[
A_{\mathrm{elim}} x = b_{\mathrm{elim}}
\f]
so a linear solver.

\f$ x \f$ is the solution of the original problem. No further boundary corrections are necessary.

#### Matrix-free implementation of \f$A_{\mathrm{elim}}\f$

The elimination procedure above is implemented in the framework by zeroing out the off-diagonal entries in the local
element matrices. Let, for instance, \f$W\f$ be a wedge element with 6 nodes. Of those 6 nodes, 3 are interior
(\f$j = 1, 2, 3\f$), and the remaining 3 are on the Dirichlet boundary (\f$j = 4, 5, 6\f$).
The local element matrix \f$A^W\f$ is of size \f$6\times 6\f$, and has the following block-structure (similar to the
global matrix after rearranging the degrees of freedom above):
\f[
A^W =
\begin{pmatrix}
A^W_{ii} & A^W_{id} \\
A^W_{di} & A^W_{dd}
\end{pmatrix}.
\f]
The symmetric elimination process simply zeroes out the off-diagonal entries in rows and columns corresponding to the
boundary nodes:
\f[
A_{\mathrm{elim}}^W =
\begin{pmatrix}
A^W_{ii} & 0 \\
0 & \mathrm{diag}(A^W_{dd})
\end{pmatrix}.
\f]
This approach can be realized on-the-fly in a matrix-free context, without the need to store the full local element
matrices.

### Stokes-like problems

Often we need to enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions on the velocity field in the context of a Stokes-like problem.
The approach is very similar to the one described above, but with a few subtleties:

Assuming an inf-sup stable discretization, we consider the discrete Stokes problem
\f[
Kx = \begin{pmatrix}
A & B \\
C & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
u \\
p
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
f_u \\
f_p
\end{pmatrix}
=b.
\f]
and a lifting vector \f$g\f$ (with non-zero entries on the Dirichlet boundary nodes in the velocity component).
In this definition, we explicitly allow for non-symmetric versions of \f$K\f$ due to the possible compressibility of the
fluid. 

The treatment of the RHS vector, i.e., the computation of \f$b_\mathrm{elim}\f$, works just as in the Poisson-like
case. Note that although only velocity components are prescribed, the elimination may also alter the values in the 
pressure component of the RHS.

We perform the steps just as above:
1. \f$ g_K \gets K g \f$,
2. \f$ g_D \gets \mathrm{diag}(K) g \f$,
3. \f$ b_\text{elim} \gets b - g_K \f$,
4. \f$ b_{\text{elim},d} \gets g_D \f$, i.e., setting the RHS \f$ b_\mathrm{elim} \f$ to \f$ g_D \f$ at the boundary
   nodes (only velocity components are prescribed).

The other subtlety is that of course the elimination process must also be carried out on the gradient and 
divergence-like operators \f$B\f$ and \f$C\f$. Specifically, we need to zero out rows in \f$B\f$ and columns in \f$C\f$
corresponding to the boundary nodes. Just as in the Poisson-like case, this can be realized on-the-fly in a matrix-free
context.

## Plate boundaries

Plate boundary conditions are just Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity on the plate surface. 
Nothing special here from the algebraic point of view. Refer to the Stokes-like case above.

## Free-slip

Free-slip boundary conditions model fluid flow in which the velocity components at a boundary are not constrained in 
the tangential direction, while normal velocity is fixed to zero.
