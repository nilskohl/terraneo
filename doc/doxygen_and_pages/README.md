# Doxygen documentation

## Building the documentation

Run 

```
doxygen 
```

to generate the documentation. Enter via

```
html/index.html
```

## Structure

Additionally, to the source code documentation, manually written documentation is provided in `documentation/`.
Doxygen also generates pages from markdown files in that folder.
