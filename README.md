## TODO

### Big features (definitely required - order not clear)

- [x] advection-diffusion discretization / solver
- [x] advection-diffusion boundary handling
- [ ] advection-diffusion source term handling (must add SUPG term in linear form)
- [x] ~~GMRES~~ BiCGStab(l)
- [x] BDF2 (not yet in a dedicated function, see test_heat_eq)
- [x] multigrid (some notes: a) we need higher operator quad degree than constant (not sure where exactly: diagonal,
  fine-level, everywhere?), b) two-grid V(10, 10) looks ok, otherwise with multigrid we do not get perfectly h-ind. conv rates., I
  suppose we need Galerkin coarse grid operators maybe)
- [ ] MPI parallel execution (multi-GPU, multi-node CPU)
- [ ] intra-diamond subdomain communication
- [ ] variable viscosity
- [ ] plates
- [ ] free-slip
- [ ] radial layer data assimilation

### Small features / improvements (not necessarily / maybe required)

- [ ] cube-like test case (this may require some new FE features)
- [ ] performance engineering
- [x] ~~curved wedges~~ the wedges are curved (unlike I assumed when writing this)
- [ ] particles(?)
- [x] matrix export / assembly (implemented for debugging - not for actual use)
- [ ] CPU SIMD kernels

### Documentation / cleanup / refactoring

- [ ] Github page
- [x] Doxygen
- [ ] Doxygen page
- [x] move mask stuff that generalizes away from shell namespace
- [ ] sort out what is spherical shell specific and what is not
