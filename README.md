# TerraNeoX

## Building

### Dependencies

Mandatory:
* MPI (e.g. OpenMPI)

Optional:
* CUDA (for GPU support)

### On the LMU systems (`cachemiss`, `memoryleak`) for usage with CUDA:

```
$ module load mpi.ompi
$ module load nvidia-hpc

$ mkdir terraneox-build

$ ll
terraneox/               # <== the cloned source code
terraneox-build/

$ cd terraneox-build

$ cmake ../terraneox/ -Kokkos_ENABLE_CUDA=ON

# Build tests
$ cd tests
$ make -j16
```

Note the capitalization: it must be `Kokkos_ENABLE_CUDA=ON`, NOT `KOKKOS_ENABLE_CUDA=ON`.


## TODO

### Big features (definitely required - order not clear)

- [x] advection-diffusion discretization / solver
- [x] advection-diffusion boundary handling
- [ ] advection-diffusion source term handling (must add SUPG term in linear form)
- [x] ~~GMRES~~ BiCGStab(l)
- [x] BDF2 (not yet in a dedicated function, see test_heat_eq)
- [x] multigrid (some notes: a) we need higher operator quad degree than constant (not sure where exactly: diagonal,
  fine-level, everywhere?), b) two-grid V(10, 10) looks ok, otherwise with multigrid we do not get perfectly h-ind. conv
  rates., I
  suppose we need Galerkin coarse grid operators maybe)
- [x] MPI parallel execution (multi-GPU, multi-node CPU)
- [ ] intra-diamond subdomain communication (then also test/fix boundary handling in operators/tests - subdomain
  boundaries are sometimes treated as domain boundaries even if they are not)
- [ ] variable viscosity
- [ ] plates
- [ ] free-slip
- [ ] compressible Stokes
- [x] FGMRES (BiCGStab works well mostly - but seems to randomly produce NaNs occasionally (not 100% sure if related to the solver but it is very likely))
- [ ] Galerkin coarsening
- [ ] iterative refinement
- [ ] spherical harmonics helper
- [ ] radial profiles loader
- [x] radial layer data assimilation
- [x] timing(tree?)
- [x] ~~compress VTK(?)~~ XDMF output (binary, actual float data, and ~~/or~~ ~~HDF5/ADIOS2~~ with a single mesh file)
- [x] CLI interface / parameter files

### Small features / improvements (not necessarily / maybe required)

- [ ] cube-like test case (this may require some new FE features)
- [ ] performance engineering
- [x] ~~curved wedges~~ the wedges are curved (unlike I assumed when writing this)
- [ ] particles(?)
- [x] matrix export / assembly (implemented for debugging - not for actual use)
- [ ] CPU SIMD kernels
- [ ] adapt solver ctor like in FGMRES (I think that is the best design)

### Documentation / cleanup / refactoring

- [ ] Github page
- [x] Doxygen
- [ ] Doxygen page
- [x] move mask stuff that generalizes away from shell namespace
- [ ] sort out what is spherical shell specific and what is not
